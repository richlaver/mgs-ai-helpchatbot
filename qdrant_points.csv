Derived instruments are similar to composite type but the user has the ability to include child instruments regardless of the location/type/subtype. An example of a derived instrument is a cant (that is, height difference) between two prisms on a railway track. The tilt cannot be calculated without both readings so the calculation behaviour is blocking; the prisms are read in turn a short time apart to a short non-zero buffer is needed. An example of a non-blocking derived instrument is one that plots movement of prisms along a rail track at a particular time; the buffer must be large enough to capture all prisms but we don’t mind if one or more is missing. ![image:db://images/291](db://images/291) Figure 5: Examples of derived instruments a) Cant calculation, b) simple profile along railway track To watch the Web User Manual video on Grouped Instruments (An Overview) , simply click on the thumbnail or link below:",[]

Typical uses of the display groups include showing movements on top of the image of a specific building; and showing tunnel convergence between multiple instruments overlaid on a cross-section of the tunnel. ![image:db://images/617](db://images/617) Display Groups Prerequisites for creating Display Groups: Before choosing instrument readings to display on an image, ensure that there is a display group class type and class. Check whether these exist in Data Manager > Admin > Data Object Definition > Class Type and Data Manager > Admin > Data Object Definition > Class. Create an Object Type to group your instruments or check whether they exist in Data Manager > Admin > Data Object Configuration > Object Definition.

Use the image editing software to modify the image you want. Objects of the group display class can only display instruments that already exist. As they are commonly used to show convergence or differential displacement between two individual instruments, if you want to show such calculated values then you need to ensure that the relevant derived instruments exist. The simplest way to add instruments to a group display class object is via the map.

Turn Reset Off while Breach is OPEN You can select this checkbox to turn Reset Off if the breach is in OPEN status. Include NULL readings in Review check Select this checkbox to include NULL readings in Review check to consider the reading as normal along with other normal readings. Suppose a reading is null, then it can be set as normal by selecting this field. Review notification option Send notification for all breaches Select this option to get notifications for all breaches. Send notification for last breach Select this option to get notified only for last breach. Send notification only for last state Select this option to get notified only if the last/latest taken on has a breach value. If latest taken on has a normal value, then notification does not occur. Note on Send Notification for last breach vs Send Notification only for last state: In the case of Send Notification for Last Breach , when you add data in bulk, the system will search for the most recent breach set and send a notification for the first occurrence of that breach, regardless of the instrument's current state.

Calculation fields : Once you select the subtype, calculations under that subtype get listed. You can select the needed one. Filter Lower and Upper Bound : You can specify that the aggregating function should only consider a subset of the children. The subset is determined by a chosen field having values within a lower and upper bound. The boundaries of the limiting range can be specified using Position or Calibrations or Calculated calibrations. Filter by Field : You can filter by fields used to set the boundaries. For example, if there are 20 children for a composite instrument whose positions start from 0 to 19, if the user needs min/max values only from Child 5 to 15, and you can filter lower and upper bound as parent calibrations. Give 5 and 15 for those calibrations and set ‘Filter by Field’ as Position. If there is no Lower and Upper bound provided, then the method returns the result by considering all the children. If there are lower and upper bound provided (set from parent calibrations), and there is no value set for it, then no result will generate. For the depth functions, there is a Return Field - the value which needs to be returned corresponding to the min/max result, which can be Position, Order or Depth (if any).

A new revision is created for Master too. Check the current and previous files to see which revision option is to be selected. To create revision with the Fix functionality, perform the following steps: Click Fix . The revision interface displays, with the following fields: (All the fields are auto filled) Parent Instrument Name (not editable), Ground Level (Editable), Instrument Level (Editable) – update this if the top of pipe has been extended or shortened otherwise the level of the children (=[parent instrument level] – depth) will be incorrect. Relationship Order (not editable) Bottom Point is the point on graph representing the displacement of the bottom of the bottom-most rod in an inclinometer. The value is usually, zero. And will plot a distance below the lowest child based on the equal spacing of the other children. So if inclinometer probe/rod length is 0.5m then the bottom point will plot 0.5m below the lowest child. Select Revise option from the dropdown menu. The following are the 4 revising options available in the dropdown menu: Top Extended : if a new child (or children) or sensor is added on top Bottom Extended : if a new child (or children) or sensor is added on bottom Top Shortened : if a new child (or children) or sensor is removed from top Bottom Shortened : if a new child (or children) or sensor is removed from bottom New fields appear. No of Elements extended shows the no of children extended or shortened. Click the Show Children The existing children get displayed in a table with options to add new/remove children. In the table, enter Child Name , Position and Instrument Level, so as to match with the current file. Instrument Level will fill automatically based on default Instrument Level calculation or based on instr_level cali_cals if set. Position/depth values are usually spaced regularly, if you enter the top two children and press Autofill then the remaining children will be populated based on the spacing between the top two. IMPORTANT: at this point make sure your a) child depth/position values match with the new file or the files values will not be recongnised, and b) your combination of master instrument level and child position/depths produced the correct child level values – it is easy to forget to update the master instrument level in earlier steps. Select from the different calibration options for setting calibrations for the children (the values produced all of the methods are displayed for final confirmation before being applied) : Re-initialize and carry from most recent (Only for Extension): Calibrations values for all the children are taken from current data file based on ‘Get from’ mapping. ‘Get from’ fields are setup in the instrument model. For example a typical child inclinometer incremental displacement formula is of the form disp_a = (reading_a - initial_a + carry_a) which are cumulatively summed to get overall displacement. To reinitialize we would a) ‘get’ the initial_a value ‘from’ the current file’s reading_a value, b) ‘get’ the carry_a value ‘from’ the most recent disp_a value. Add manually via interface : Applicable for both Extension and Shortening. Calibration values for new child needs to add one by one via interface. All children get listed in the dropdown, but only newly added one is selectable. Set from previous calculations : Applicable for both extension and shortening. You can set calibrations for the new children from existing children by selecting the required calculation or calibration from the dropdown. Any calibration fields you don’t explicitly configure will get their values from the most recent revision.

You can override the backend default calculation by creating a calculated calibration field with the special name “instr_level”. Suppose the formula is based on interval, it shows (and means) the difference between positions of instruments. (Position is same as sensor depth renamed) Important points to note on Calculated Calibration functionality: Calculated calibration fields (cali_calcs) – special calibration fields that contain a formula to evaluate. To resolve ambiguity in grouped instrument cali_calcs formulas parent and child fields must be prefixed respectively with “parent.” and “child.”, for example - child.easting, parent.northing and so on. Exactly when the cali_calcs formulas are executed depends on the formulas themselves: If the formulas reference a data field or calculated field then they are executed every time there is a data point. Thus, the calculation represents a current/latest value. If the formulas DO NOT reference a data field or a calculated field then they are executed only when calibration or setup fields are edited or a revision happens. Calculated calibrations are displayed in a new tab in View/Edit page. Examples of Calculated Calibrations : parent.instr_level-child.position : This is to calculate child instr_level using Parent Instrument level and Child Position.

Even when the Alert value is set as 100, if the reading comes as 51 or 101 (which is above 50 filter value), it goes into Quarantine. Filter From value has to be always lower than Filter To value. Setting Filter From-To is optional.
