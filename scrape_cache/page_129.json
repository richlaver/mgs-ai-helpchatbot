Then click open the Data Manager.</p>\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Instrumentation &gt; Data &gt; Audit page &gt; Status Log</strong> tab.</p>\n<p>Or</p>\n<p><strong>Instrumentation &gt; Data &gt; View/Edit &gt; Show Status Log</strong> button.</p>\n<p>You can view the status log for a record in the Audit page.</p>\n<p>A hierarchy is available to filter the instruments for which status log is to be viewed.</p>\n<p>Click Search. The search results with the status details of the instruments belonging to that selection are listed with the corresponding Record IDs. You can access the status log of an instrument from View/Edit page as you click the Show Status Log button here.</p>\n<p>A log is a file which captures the events and edits for each record of data readings created in each cycle of the Record-Audit chain process. It holds the statuses and reason codes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"560\" src=\"db://images/629\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"1273\"/>\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Status Log</strong></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>RECORD STATUS</strong></h4>\n<p>The different types of record statuses are identified, and defined as follows:</p>\n<p>NEW: This is new data coming into the system</p>\n<p>LIVE: Approved records are displayed with the status \u2018LIVE\u2019</p>\n<p>SUP: These are superseded records due to duplication and other reasons</p>\n<p>DEL: These are records that have been rejected from the system</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h4><strong>EDIT STATUS</strong></h4>\n<p>Edit status determines how the record was created or submitted into the record audit chain. Statuses are defined as follows:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"589\" src=\"db://images/630\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"733\"/></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>REASON CODES</strong></h4>\n<p>When status changes are required, a reason code is assigned. This reason code is added to data records for the last action and can be determined in the change log status records, to show how the record reached the investigation or approval state.</p>\n<p>Unlike process statuses, reason codes grow as the record audit process is enhanced. The table below defines the reasons codes required:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"696\" src=\"db://images/631\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"704\"/></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>LOAD PROCESS</strong></h4>\n<p>The load process begins with the Daily Data File (DDF) being uploaded onto the system. DDF can be uploaded in various formats such as FTP, email, manual upload and others. This process deals with the validation and processing of the DDF as a whole, from the point of receiving up to the point of sending it to the calculation process.</p>\n<p>The load process fails with the DDF if the instrument is not found in the system.</p>\n<p>A load status is assigned to each record and only records that are marked PASSED are sent to the calculate process.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>CALCULATE PROCESS</strong></h4>\n<p>Once a record has completed the previous process (Load), it proceeds to Calculate. Various pre-defined calculations are performed on the imported data and converted to processed data. The processed data is then further validated and secondary calculations are performed to obtain further derived data or groups, called post-processed data.</p>\n<p>The calculate process fails when there is an error in any calculation.</p>\n<p>A calculate status is assigned to each record and only records that are marked PASSED are sent to the next process.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h4><strong>REVIEW PROCESS</strong></h4>\n<p>There are three sections in the Review process.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Filter Fail:</p>\n<p>The filter sub-process fails a record when the readings are beyond pre-defined limits categorized in various filters. These readings are considered to be filter breaches, and they are sent to the DUI process for further action.</p>\n<p>Scenario 1: A record breaches a filter review</p>\n<p>Review Status is set to FAILED, Edit Status is changed to DUI, and Reason Code is set to FILTER FAILED.</p>\n<p>Scenario 2: A record does NOT breach a filter</p>\n<p>Record is submitted to Alarm review process.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alarm Fail:</p>\n<p>Once a record has completed the previous sub-process (Filter) it proceeds to the Alarm sub-process. The record is then analyzed to capture any readings which might create alarms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a record requires action from the alarm review (record is added to AAA pending) then Review Status is set to FAILED, edit status is changed to DUI, and reason code is set to ALARM FAILED.</li>\n<li>If no new action is required and there has been no record with an edit status of DUI with reason code ALARM FAILED since last approval, then Review Status is set to PASSED.</li>\n<li>If no new action is required and there has been a record with an edit status of DUI with reason code ALARM FAILED since last approval, then Review Status is set to FAILED, edit status is changed to DUI and reason code is set to ALARM FAILED.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Publish Fail:</p>\n<p>Once a record has completed and passed the previous sub-process (Alarm) it proceeds to Publish Review. The record is held to prevent the release of data without authorization.</p>\n<p>There is a simple check on the source of the data for Publish Approval. If data is presented for Publish Review, then it has passed all other review checks (alarms, filter) and has its edit status checked against a simple data source table (see below).</p>\n<p>The table configures which data sources requires manual approval if any i.e. a simple y/n for checking required against:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Load Auto</li>\n<li>New Load Manual</li>\n<li>New Load User</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If New Load User is designated as requiring review, then a further selection criteria of user type is presented for selection that is a simple y/n for checking against user types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administrator</li>\n<li>Approver</li>\n<li>Editor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Edit Status is APPROVED then it bypasses this review and be published to the portal.</p>\n<p>If the data source review above does not require further approval, then REVIEW status is set as PASSED and Reason Code is set to REVIEW PASSED.</p>\n<p>If the data source review above does require further approval, then records will have REVIEW status as FAILED with a reason code of PUBLISH FAIL, and they are sent to the DUI process for further action.</p>\n<p>All records published to the portal has Edit Status of APPROVED.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>EDIT STATUS</strong></h4>\n<p>Edit Status is a unique status that is applied to the record based on certain criteria anywhere in the record audit chain process. The edit status is broken down into two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Edit Before</li>\n<li>Edit After</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Edit Before captures the state of the record prior to a change and the Edit After captures the state of the record after a change has occurred, including reason codes where applicable.</p>\n<p>Whenever a record changes state, a log of the actions is written and maintained upon saving.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.maxwellgeosystems.com/manuals/demo-manual/manual-web-content-highlight.php?manual_id=121", "videos": []}}
