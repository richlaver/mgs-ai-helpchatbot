While setting up the instrument you can define whether it is a Composite instrument, with Parent and Children.</p>\n<p>For this, once you select the Instrument Setup fields, select the <strong>Composite Instrument</strong> checkbox.</p>\n<p>Here you can define the parent instrument and create any number of child instruments with a Position order.</p>\n<p>Adopt a method of naming the Parent and the children.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example, name the Parent as: IN_A</p>\n<p>While you enter the number of children and click the <strong>Generate</strong> button, Child names auto-populates of the form such as: IN_A_01, IN _A_02, IN_A_03 and so on.</p>\n<p>After you select the Positions and click the <strong>Continue</strong> button, the interface for entering the calibration details appear. As you save the configuration, the parent and children get linked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Method 2:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second way to setup Composite instrument is by uploading the Setup and Calibration Files of the Parent and the Children when there is substantial data.</p>\n<p>For this, download the setup file from the <strong>Model</strong> interface or the <strong>Load Setup File</strong> interface.</p>\n<p>Once you open the excel file, enter the child and parent details in the same file.</p>\n<p>Enter the child details along with the sensor level for each.</p>\n<p>In \u2018Parent\u2019 column, you input the parent instrument for example - \u2018IN_A\u2019</p>\n<p>Location details are only needed for parent instruments.</p>\n<p>Upload the file to the system using the <strong>Load Setup File</strong> interface.</p>\n<p>Now, download the calibration file for the child type from the <strong>Model</strong> interface or the <strong>Load Calibration File</strong> interface.</p>\n<p>Once you enter the calibration data, upload the file to the system using the <strong>Load Calibration File</strong> interface.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Master has calibration fields you need to download corresponding calibration file and provide data. This leads to creation of instruments and relationships.</p>\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n<h4><strong>Note: </strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The sensor level is required for all compound instruments.</li>\n<li>This\u00a0does not always need to depict depth.</li>\n<li>It can be used purely to determine the order of calculation.</li>\n<li>Once you create the list of children, choose in which order the calculations are to be done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To watch the\u00a0<strong>Web User Manual video</strong>\u00a0on\u00a0<strong>Composite Relationships</strong>, simply click on the thumbnail or link below:</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzGMv9-oaXM\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.maxwellgeosystems.com/manuals/demo-manual/manual-web-content-highlight.php?manual_id=178", "videos": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzGMv9-oaXM", "title": "How To: Create Composite Relationships"}]}}
