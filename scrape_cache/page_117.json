(To access the Model Setup, go to Admin &gt; Data Object Configuration &gt; Object Definition &gt; Model tab)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The different scenarios relating to Recalculation are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Compound Master Model (Composite or Derived Master)</strong>:</p>\n<p>Calculation field Edit and Recalculate: If the parent init/loop/end calculates alter the children (i.e there are parent with formulas child.field=...) then the parent and its children are recalculated. If the parent init/loop/end formulas don\u2019t alter the children then there is no need to recalculate the children and only the parent will recalculate using the already calculated children.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Composite/Derived Child Model:</strong></p>\n<p>Calculation field edit and Recalculate: All records from all children under the type and subtype will be recalculated (Recalculation will be grouped by the Parents and children) which will cause the parent instruments to be recalculated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Composite/Derived Child Model:</strong></p>\n<p>Calculated Calibration field edit and Recalculate: Only the\u00a0last reading of all children will be recalculated. (Recalculation will be grouped by the Parents and children)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Normal Instruments Model</strong>:</p>\n<p>Calculation field add/edit and Recalculate: All records from all instruments under the type/subtype will be recalculated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Normal Instruments Model:</strong></p>\n<p>Calculated Calibration field add/edit and Recalculate: Only the\u00a0last reading in each revision of all children will be recalculated.</p>", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.maxwellgeosystems.com/manuals/demo-manual/manual-web-content-highlight.php?manual_id=237", "videos": []}}
