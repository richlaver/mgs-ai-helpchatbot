{"page_content": "\n<h1>MissionOS Platform Architecture</h1>\n<div id=\"relatedtags\"></div>\n<p class=\"headingp\" style=\"font-size:30px;margin-bottom:20px;\">Version:MissionOS_2.0</p>\n<p>MissionOS is an online platform that facilitates the monitoring and management of instrumentation and construction data, and the management of any associated risk.</p>\n<h4>The core components of MissionOS are:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Loader</li>\n<li>Core process</li>\n<li>Meta Data</li>\n<li>Data Manager</li>\n<li>Portal</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n<h4><strong>Loader</strong></h4>\n<p>Loader deals with loading instrument or construction data on to the system. Data can reach the system through the following means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GDL (Generic data Loader)</li>\n<li>Data file upload</li>\n<li>Inline edit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GDL - Loads data on to the system from instrument data files of various formats. This is an automatic or background procedure with the ability to fetch files from data sources like FTP, SFTP and Dropbox.</p>\n<p>Data file upload - The user can directly upload the data file to the system.</p>\n<p>Inline edit - The user can enter data for an instrument through the inline edit feature in the system.</p>\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n<h4><strong>Core Process</strong></h4>\n<p>Core process deals with processing the raw data entered in to the system and consists of the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data validation</li>\n<li>Calculation engine</li>\n<li>Review engine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data validation - Validates the data entering the system and ensures only relevant data is uploaded. Data that fails validation falls into a Load fail condition.</p>\n<p>Calculation Engine - Performs the necessary calculations on the instrument readings. Calculations are based on the formulae applied and configurations on the particular instrument type. Entries which fail calculation falls into a calculate-fail case.</p>\n<p>Review engine - Compares the instrument readings and calculates values against pre-set review levels. Any reading which breaches a review level fails in a review fail case and is promptly notified to the relevant users.</p>\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n<h4><strong>Metadata</strong></h4>\n<p>Metadata is a part of the Data Manager. Metadata deals with setting the essential configurations for an instrument type/subtype. Through this interface, you can specify the parameters for a particular instrument type/subtype.\u00a0 One can define the calculation fields for a particular instrument type/subtype and set formulae for those fields too. These settings and configurations are used at the stages of data loading and core process.</p>\n<p>Metadata also deals with setting up the default graph templates and reporting templates (GDT- generic data tables) for the particular instrument type/subtypes.</p>\n<p>Metadata can also be used to configure the necessary fields for creating a set up file and calibration files for the instrument.</p>\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n<h4><strong>Data Manager</strong></h4>\n<p>Data Manager contains the various sections for the entire system configuration. The basic elements of the Data Manager are core portal set up configurations such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project setup</li>\n<li>User and user group management</li>\n<li>Hierarchy and user permission management</li>\n<li>Map setup for the portal</li>\n<li>Notification management</li>\n<li>Location management</li>\n<li>Review/audit configuration</li>\n<li>Reporting related configurations</li>\n<li>Object (instrument/construction) metadata (see Metadata section)</li>\n<li>GDL configurations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Project setup - Deals with the basic settings for a project such as company name, logo, time zone etc.</p>\n<p>User and user group management - Deals with managing the users in the system. The four kinds of users in the system are admin, editor, viewer and approver. These four kinds of users have unique operational privileges within the system. Users are further categorised into various user groups to provide them with relevant access or restrictions in the system.</p>\n<p>Hierarchy and user permission management - The system hierarchy consists of project, contract, site and zone. There can be one or more projects and projects containing contracts. Contracts contain one or multiple sites and sites themselves contain one or more zones. Access to the different projects and their contracts are controlled by allowing permissions to user groups. Users inherit these permissions from their user groups.</p>\n<p>Map setup for the portal - Deals with setting up maps and their zoom boxes for the portal. There is a base map and one or more aerial and construction maps. Zoom boxes represent an area on the map where the user can zoom into the portal.</p>\n<p>Notification management - Deals with enabling/disabling various kinds of notifications produced by the system. Notifications can be enabled or disabled for a particular notification group and the user only receives notifications based on the notification group configuration they belong to. The various forms of notifications are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DUI</li>\n<li>Instrument overdue</li>\n<li>Loader notifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Location management - Manages locations for the instruments in the system.</p>\n<p>Review/audit configuration - Deals with the configurations for the review and audit process. Users can configure how the data must be treated under review fail and who all can take various actions at the time of review fail.</p>\n<p>Reporting related configurations - Deals with scheduling a time to send a particular report and archiving that report.</p>\n<p>GDL configurations - Deals with the necessary configurations for the GDL that being raw data file mapping configurations and data source configuration.</p>\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n<h4><strong>Portal</strong></h4>\n<p>Portal provides the processed information to the user. The processed data is converted into a comprehensible format using graphs and various reports. The portal provides the option to choose the required instruments or jobs and view the relevant information. Graphs can be customized to desired graph layout for the ease of the user.</p>\n<p>The portal also contains a report creation section where the user can create reports by specifying different parameters. Users can create batch reports, summary reports and binder reports using this section. Binder reports are further used for scheduling a report to be sent at a particular time. Reports are available in PDF and CSV form. Furthermore, the user can opt for a web report, which can be viewed on the web page itself.</p>", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.maxwellgeosystems.com/manuals/demo-manual/manual-web-content-highlight.php?manual_id=7", "videos": []}}
