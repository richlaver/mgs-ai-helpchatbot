Originally in standalone databases, the system has evolved through LAN and LAN/WAN compatible multi-access databases into the current form. The application now resides fully on the web and is built within the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) framework. This simple scripting platform has proven resilient to change and has evolved rapidly to provide a rich experience to web users. The MySQL database is fast and efficient and has no software limitation on size. The MissionOS software can be implemented in a variety of web configurations, either hosted as fully virtualised, sharing disk space and processor time on a server farm or through dedicated collocated servers. This introduces flexibility and compatibility to the client needs.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"531\" src=\"db://images/2\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"671\"/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The software system is autonomous and currently uses only high-charts graphing library as an embedded third-party application. The rest of the software is developed entirely in-house giving more scope and flexibility to innovate and grow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Data structures has the ability to optimise web performance even with very large data sets. Processing is performed at both the server side and client side to minimise data transfer delays. System operations are possible on all major browsers, all common operating systems on PCs, tablets with touch screens and smart phones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The MissionOS products fall into two delivery streams: Design stream (<strong>Mission Monitor</strong>, <strong>Mission Designer</strong>) and Production stream (<strong>Mission Site</strong>, <strong>Mission Builder</strong>)</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><img height=\"890\" src=\"db://images/3\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"593\"/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.maxwellgeosystems.com/manuals/demo-manual/manual-web-content-highlight.php?manual_id=1", "videos": []}}
